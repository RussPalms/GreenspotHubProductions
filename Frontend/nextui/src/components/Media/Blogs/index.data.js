There is only one person who can make it happen, and that is you. Of course, there are many pieces to a puzzle, but it takes that first piece being laid before it can go anywhere.",

Why not leave the grass alone? Leave it be to extinction sooner rather than later to avoid future suffering from all of that trampling. You plant it from seed, then trample firmly with greed.
